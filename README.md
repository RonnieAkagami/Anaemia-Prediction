# Anaemia-Prediction

## Project Description
This project aims to predict whether a person has anemia based on image pixels of their blood (red, blue, and green pixels) and their hemoglobin (hb) levels. We used a logistic regression model to make the predictions, achieving an accuracy of 96%. Additionally, we utilized GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning to ensure the most optimal model.

## Installation
To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed along with several libraries. You can install the required libraries using pip:

```python
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
